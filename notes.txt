> We can make any widget tappable using InkWell or GestureDetector, but InkWell also provides a nice visual feedback if the
    user taps an item, while GestureDetector does not provide this.

> use .pushReplacement in place of .push (in Navigator) if you want to replace the current screen with a new screen,
    rather than pushing than pushing the new screen on the top of existing screens.

> riverpod gives us ways to manage dynamic data and cross widget state without having the trouble to pass 
    those informations along the screens/widgets manually.
